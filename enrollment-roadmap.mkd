in current IETF protocols.

# Introduction

There are numerous mechanisms being proposed to solve the problem
of securely introducing a new devices into an existing managed network.

This document provides an overview of the different mechanisms showing what
technologies are common.  The document starts with a diagram showing the
various components and how they go together to form five enrollment
scenarios.

# Security Considerations

This document includes a tradeoff of the security attributes of the different
protocols, and so the entire document contains security advice.

# IANA Considerations

This document does not define any new protocols, and therefore does not
have any IANA Considerations.

# Acknowledgements

TBD
